# CSARCH2 Simulation Project
A machine project submitted in partial fulfillment of the group's CSARCH2 course. The group was tasked to create an IEEE-754 Binary-32 Floating Point Operation web application that accepts inputs in both binary and base-2. The web application can perform addition operations through both G/R/S rounding and normal rounding modes.

# Web Application Usage
1. Access the website through this link: 
2. Input two binary or base-2 operands
3. Click `Calculate`
4. [FOR G/R/S Rounding] Input the number of supported digits for rounding (Default: 32)
5. [OPTIONAL DOWNLOAD] The result can be downloaded as a text file
